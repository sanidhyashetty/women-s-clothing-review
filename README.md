1.Set Up Your Environment

2.Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, nltk). Use pip to install them if they are not already installed.
Load and Prepare the Data

3.Load Data: Obtain the dataset from a source (e.g., a URL or local file) and load it into a pandas DataFrame.
Preprocess Data: Clean and preprocess the review text data by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords. Handle any missing values and convert the target variable to a suitable format.
Prepare Data for Modeling

4.Define Features and Target Variable: Specify which columns will be used as features (text data) and which will be used as the target variable (sentiment labels).
Split Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance properly.
Feature Extraction

5.Convert Text to Numerical Features: Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform the text data into numerical features that can be used by the machine learning model.
Train the Model

6.Train Classifier: Select and train a classification model (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes) using the training data.
Evaluate and Predict

7.Evaluate Model: Assess the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy and classification report.
8.Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new or unseen reviews.
